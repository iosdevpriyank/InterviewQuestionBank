### Question 1: What is a Class in Swift?

**Answer:**
A class in Swift is a blueprint for creating objects. It supports inheritance, meaning you can create subclasses that inherit properties and methods from the parent class.

```swift
class Animal {
    var name: String
    init(name: String) {
        self.name = name
    }
    func speak() {
        print("\(name) makes a sound")
    }
}
